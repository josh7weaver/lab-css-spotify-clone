# CIS 122: Spotify Clone

## Introduction

Everyone likes music, right? Odds are if you do, you've heard of Spotify. Today we're going to copy an older (and simpler) version of the Spotify home page:

All of the necessary assets and images are included in the starter code. If you'd like a full length PDF version of the webite as reference, [check out this link](https://github.com/josh7weaver/lab-css-spotify-clone/raw/master/spotify-prototype.pdf).

# Exercise
_Note: The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html` file, along with a spot for your css which holds the theme colors in a comment._

## Deliverables

You will receive the images and resources in the starter code. Write your CSS and HTML in the provided files. Remember to follow good practices.

## Tips

* Start by breaking the HTML up with appropriate tags.
* Tackle the sections one by one, and don't be distracted by the other sections not looking correct yet.

## Steps

The page is split into 4 sections. Add the appropriate HTML5 tags, classes, and/or id's you need to style the page to match the image (PDF linked to above.)

#### Navbar

- The navbar should be `position: fixed`.
- Float the image left, and float a `ul` with the links right.

#### Large image background with text

- Check out [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) on centering things.

#### What's on Spotify section

- It looks like the `div`s take up about a third of the container each. How can you represent this in code?

#### Green Section

- It looks like we have 2 main pieces, a `div` with the text content, and the image of the Spotify player. Position these according to the surrounding green `div`.
- Position the Spotify logo absolutely according to the Green `div`.
